# Market-Segmentation-Analysis
The aim of the project is to analyze the market in India to help an Agri Tech start-up to sell their first Bio-pesticide.I applied different Segmentation approaches to segment our data and analyzed the data using Pandas profiling for describing the segments based on chosen criteria. I had broken down the problem into simpler steps and also used fermi estimation initially.After doing an analysis of our data and applying different models, I need to select a market segment that is more profitable as compared to others.   So we concluded that the Agri-Tech start-up should be promoted in those areas where the percentage of agriculture to take place is more as those places will only make use of most of the bio-pesticides for their agriculture.
